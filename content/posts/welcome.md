Welcome to my personal website! This is where I'll share thoughts on machine learning, software development, and various technical topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** — insights from research and practical applications
- **Technical Deep Dives** — exploring how things work under the hood

Stay tuned for more content!
